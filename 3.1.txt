---// Introducing Virtual Enviroments //---


Virtual enviroment is a very usefull tool for python developers specially who are developing a large project .
For example , we are working on a website and there are special conditions that we have to use 2 defferent versions of Django .
We can't import both of them in our project , so we have to make a virtual enviroment and proceed our projects there .Then we can add and import
different versions of libraries or other tools there .

I have used both linux Terminal and windows cmd to make a virtual enviroment .

1. Linux :
We can use anaconda virtual enviroment toolkit or python virtual enviroment .I have used anaconda .
after installing anaconda , for creating a virtual enviroment we can use this comand :
"conda create -n yourvirtualenvname python=x.x anaconda "

which "yourvirtualenvname" is your virtual enviroment name and python=x.x is the version of your python .
after creating the venv , you have to activate it .For that we can use :

"source activate yourenvname"
and your venv will be active .

To see the venvs you can use :

"conda info -e"

2. Windows

2.1 :Open windows cmd .
